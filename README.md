# Hierarchical-Modelling
Hierarchical Modelling or multi-level spatial analysis of crime-data in Maryland
Over the past decades, several studies have explored the trends in crime rates for different regions of the
USA emphasizing the varying crime rate in the USA. This study attempts to explore the relationship
between a select indicators of crime in the State of Maryland over time at the county level. Specifically,
the study explores trends crime rate against property and hate crime rates. The study defines crime
against property as crime committed for monetary gains such as offences of burglary, theft or arson.
Such crimes have absence of force or threat of force against the victims.1 On the other hand, hate
crime is one where the intent of the offender is to cause a physical or mental harm to the victim. There
have several studies that have established a linear relationship for several forms of crimes across cities
of the USA (Miethe, Hughes, and McDowall 1991). In addition to this, the study also explores the
relationship of number of hate crime in the counties of Maryland using Generalised linear mixed effects
models. Since, the data has a panel arrangement, i.e., the data are collected by each county and year
with data available for count of different forms of crimes, therefore, statistically, it makes theoretical
sense to use Poisson error term instead of standard Gaussian error term for model fitting(Econometric
Analysis of Count Data 2008)
